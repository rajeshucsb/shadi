			<h1 class="poem">Bita & Rajesh</h1>
			
			<br />
			
			<pre>
			Under the glorious sun,
			A child was born,
			And the name Rajesh was coined. 
			</pre>
			
			<pre>
			At the first rays of dawn,
			First born in the clan she was unique & bonita,
			They named her Bita.
			</pre>
			
			<pre>
			Their paths crossed in Santa Barbara,
			Where they both went to college,
			They met and became good friends.
			</pre>
			
			<pre>
			It was time for him to graduate and move to far away lands,
			But the greater forces had their own plans,
			Economic crisis hit and he stayed in Santa Barbara.
		    </pre>
			
			<pre>
			They hung out together,
			Went ballroom dancing, played board games and ate,
			And then he asked her on a date.
		    </pre>
		
		    <pre>
			The rest of the story is history my friends,
			They are getting married on 6th of April 2013,
			And are kindly requesting your presence.			
			</pre>
